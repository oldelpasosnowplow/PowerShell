Useful PowerShell scripts I used to help manage my network.  I hope you find them useful as well.

ChangeDNS - Will allow you to change staticly set network adapters DNS servers.

ChangeManager - Allows you to change old managers to new managers under the Organization tab in the User Account in Active Directory.
