Useful PowerShell scripts I used to help manage my network.  I hope you find them useful as well.

1. ChangeDNS will allow you to change staticly set NICs DNS servers.
2. ChangeManager allows you to change old managers to new managers under the Organization tab in the User Account in Active Directory
3. WSUSReport will generate and email a nice colorful report to an email address.  The report shows computer status on updates, errors and last reboots.
